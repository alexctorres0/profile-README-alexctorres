this is a little bit about me!

I hope to familiarize myself with R and Python terminology and structures. i am very interested in learning about how economists use coding skills to give them an edge when digesting the same numbers report everyoen else sees. The reason this is, is beacuse ive been taking investing seriously, and part of that is analyzing not only the company's financial reports but also more external environmental factors like macro and monetary trends, which could all effect future pricing. I hope learning about how it's used in the markets would be useful.

Apart from school, I started spendning multiple days a week in the gym, and after a couple month, I have come to fall in love with the slow progressive change that snowballs into something better. I have been learning about how to do it the right way, but also something that comes naturally for me  because afterall i do not want to be a bodybuilder, just healtheier.
